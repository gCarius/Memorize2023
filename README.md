## 🧠 What I Learned

- My first real Swift and Xcode project  
- Gained a deep understanding of **SwiftUI concepts** like `@State`, `@ObservedObject`, and `ViewBuilder`  
- Practiced using the **MVVM design pattern** in iOS development  
- Learned how to build responsive UIs that adapt to different screen sizes  
- Got comfortable debugging in Xcode and using Previews effectively
